Nmap, short for Network Mapper
the different approaches that Nmap uses to discover live hosts:
1. ARP scan: This scan uses ARP requests to discover live hosts
2. ICMP scan: This scan uses ICMP requests to identify live hosts
3. TCP/UDP ping scan: This scan sends packets to TCP ports and UDP ports to determine live hosts.

A _network segment_ is a group of computers connected using a shared medium. For instance, the medium can be the Ethernet switch or WiFi access point. In an IP network, a _subnetwork_ is usually the equivalent of one or more network segments connected together and configured to use the same router. ***The network segment refers to a physical connection, while a subnetwork refers to a logical connection.***

Generally speaking, your system would be connected to one of the network segments/subnetworks. A subnetwork, or simply a subnet, has its own IP address range and is connected to a more extensive network via a router. There might be a firewall enforcing security policies depending on each network.


![[Subnets.png]]


- Subnets with `/16`, which means that the subnet mask can be written as `255.255.0.0`. This subnet can have around 65 thousand hosts.
- Subnets with `/24`, which indicates that the subnet mask can be expressed as `255.255.255.0`. This subnet can have around 250 hosts

If you are connected to the same subnet, you would expect your scanner to rely on ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) queries to discover live hosts. An ARP query aims to get the hardware address (MAC address) so that communication over the link-layer becomes possible; however, we can use this to infer that the host is online

***If you are in Network A, you can use ARP only to discover the devices within that subnet (10.1.100.0/24). Suppose you are connected to a subnet different from the subnet of the target system(s). In that case, all packets generated by your scanner will be routed via the default gateway (router) to reach the systems on another subnet; however, the ARP queries won’t be routed and hence cannot cross the subnet router. ARP is a link-layer protocol, and ARP packets are bound to their subnet.***

#### Enumerating Targets

Examples of target specification are:

- list: `MACHINE_IP scanme.nmap.org example.com` will scan 3 IP addresses.
- range: `10.11.12.15-20` will scan 6 IP addresses: `10.11.12.15`, `10.11.12.16`,… and `10.11.12.20`.
- subnet: `MACHINE_IP/30` will scan 4 IP addresses.

can also provide a file as input for your list of targets, `nmap -iL list_of_hosts.txt`

```sh
nmap -iL list_of_hosts.txt
```

want to check the list of hosts that Nmap will scan, you can use `nmap -sL TARGETS`. This option will give you a detailed list of the hosts that Nmap will scan without scanning them; however, Nmap will attempt a reverse-DNS resolution on all the targets to obtain their names. Names might reveal various information to the pentester.

If you don’t want Nmap to the DNS server, you can add `-n`

#### Discovering Live Hosts

- ARP from Link Layer
- ICMP from Network Layer
- TCP from Transport Layer
- UDP from Transport Layer

![[OSI&TCPLayer.png]]

ARP has one purpose: sending a frame to the broadcast address on the network segment and asking the computer with a specific IP address to respond by providing its MAC (hardware) address.

ICMP has many types. ICMP ping uses Type 8 (Echo) and Type 0 (Echo Reply).

Although TCP and UDP are transport layers, for network scanning purposes, a scanner can send a specially-crafted packet to common TCP or UDP ports to check whether the target will respond. This method is efficient, especially when ICMP Echo is blocked.

#### Nmap Host Discovery Using ARP

1. When a _privileged_ user tries to scan targets on a local network (Ethernet), Nmap uses _ARP requests_. A privileged user is `root` or a user who belongs to `sudoers` and can run `sudo`.
2. When a _privileged_ user tries to scan targets outside the local network, Nmap uses ICMP echo requests, TCP ACK (Acknowledge) to port 80, TCP SYN (Synchronize) to port 443, and ICMP timestamp request.
3. When an _unprivileged_ user tries to scan targets outside the local network, Nmap resorts to a TCP 3-way handshake by sending SYN packets to ports 80 and 443.

Nmap, by default, uses a ping scan to find live hosts, then proceeds to scan live hosts only. If you want to use Nmap to discover online hosts without port-scanning the live systems, you can issue `nmap -sn TARGETS`

```sh
nmap -sn TARGETS
```

-sn : To discover online hosts without port-scanning the live systems

ARP scan is possible only if you are on the same subnet as the target systems. On an Ethernet (802.3) and WiFi (802.11), you need to know the MAC address of any system before you can communicate with it. The MAC address is necessary for the link-layer header; the header contains the source MAC address and the destination MAC address among other fields. To get the MAC address, the OS sends an ARP query. A host that replies to ARP queries is up. The ARP query only works if the target is on the same subnet as yourself, i.e., on the same Ethernet/WiFi. You should expect to see many ARP queries generated during a Nmap scan of a local network. If you want Nmap only to perform an ARP scan without port-scanning, you can use `nmap -PR -sn TARGETS`, where `-PR` indicates that you only want an ARP scan. The following example shows Nmap using ARP for host discovery without any port scanning.


```sh
sudo nmap -PR -sn 10.10.210.6/24
```

-PR : ARP discovery on local network

-sn : Disable port scanning. Host discovery only.

a scanner built around ARP queries: `arp-scan`; it provides many options to customize your scan

```sh
arp-scan -l
```

OR

```sh
arp-scan --localnet
```

This command will send ARP queries to all valid IP addresses on your local networks. Moreover, if your system has more than one interface and you are interested in discovering the live hosts on one of them, you can specify the interface using `-I`

```sh
sudo arp-scan -I eth0 -l
```

send ARP queries for all valid IP addresses on the `eth0` interface

```sh
sudo arp-scan 10.10.210.6/24
```

#### Nmap Host Discovery Using ICMP

```sh
nmap -PE -sn TARGET
```

```sh
sudo nmap -PE -sn MACHINE_IP/24
```

-PE : ICMP Echo Ping

We can ping every IP address on a target network and see who would respond to our `ping` (ICMP Type 8/Echo) requests with a ping reply (ICMP Type 0).

Although this would be the most straightforward approach, it is not always reliable. Many firewalls block ICMP echo; new versions of MS Windows are configured with a host firewall that blocks ICMP echo requests by default.  ***An ARP query will precede the ICMP request if your target is on the same subnet***

***Because ICMP echo requests tend to be blocked, you might also consider ICMP Timestamp or ICMP Address Mask requests to tell if a system is online. Nmap uses timestamp request (ICMP Type 13) and checks whether it will get a Timestamp reply (ICMP Type 14). Adding the `-PP` option tells Nmap to use ICMP timestamp requests.***

```sh
sudo nmap -PP -sn 10.10.68.220/24
```

-PP : ICMP Timestamp Ping

Nmap uses address mask queries (ICMP Type 17) and checks whether it gets an address mask reply (ICMP Type 18). This scan can be enabled with the option `-PM`

```sh
sudo nmap -PM -sn 10.10.68.220/24
```

-PM : ICMP Address Mask Ping

#### Nmap Host Discovery Using TCP and UDP


**TCP SYN Ping**

We can send a packet with the SYN (Synchronize) flag set to a TCP port, 80 by default, and wait for a response. An open port should reply with a SYN/ACK (Acknowledge); a closed port would result in an RST (Reset). In this case, we only check whether we will get any response to infer whether the host is up. The specific state of the port is not significant here

If you want Nmap to use TCP SYN ping, you can do so via the option `-PS` followed by the port number, range, list, or a combination of them.

`-PS21` will target port 21, while `-PS21-25` will target ports 21, 22, 23, 24, and 25. Finally `-PS80,443,8080` will target the three ports 80, 443, and 8080.

```sh
sudo nmap -PS -sn 10.10.68.220/24
```

-PS : TCP SYN Ping

**TCP ACK Ping**

this sends a packet with an ACK flag set. ***You must be running Nmap as a privileged user to be able to accomplish this. If you try it as an unprivileged user, Nmap will attempt a 3-way handshake.***

By default, port 80 is used. The syntax is similar to TCP SYN ping. `-PA` should be followed by a port number, range, list, or a combination of them. For example, consider `-PA21`, `-PA21-25` and `-PA80,443,8080`. If no port is specified, port 80 will be used.

***Any TCP packet with an ACK flag should get a TCP packet back with an RST flag set. The target responds with the RST flag set because the TCP packet with the ACK flag is not part of any ongoing connection***

![[TCPACKPing.png]]


```sh
sudo nmap -PA -sn 10.10.68.220/24
```

-PA : TCP ACK Ping

**UDP Ping**

Finally, we can use UDP to discover if the host is online. Contrary to TCP SYN ping, ***sending a UDP packet to an open port is not expected to lead to any reply. However, if we send a UDP packet to a closed UDP port, we expect to get an ICMP port unreachable packet; this indicates that the target system is up and available.***

![[UDPPing.png]]


```sh
sudo nmap -PU -sn 10.10.68.220/24
```

#### Using Reverse DNS Lookup

Nmap’s default behaviour is to use reverse-DNS online hosts. Because the hostnames can reveal a lot, this can be a helpful step. However, if you don’t want to send such DNS queries, you use `-n` to skip this step.
By default, Nmap will look up online hosts; however, you can use the option `-R` to query the DNS server even for offline hosts. If you want to use a specific DNS server, you can add the `--dns-servers DNS_SERVER` option.


|Scan Type|Example Command|
|---|---|
|ARP Scan|`sudo nmap -PR -sn MACHINE_IP/24`|
|ICMP Echo Scan|`sudo nmap -PE -sn MACHINE_IP/24`|
|ICMP Timestamp Scan|`sudo nmap -PP -sn MACHINE_IP/24`|
|ICMP Address Mask Scan|`sudo nmap -PM -sn MACHINE_IP/24`|
|TCP SYN Ping Scan|`sudo nmap -PS22,80,443 -sn MACHINE_IP/30`|
|TCP ACK Ping Scan|`sudo nmap -PA22,80,443 -sn MACHINE_IP/30`|
|UDP Ping Scan|`sudo nmap -PU53,161,162 -sn MACHINE_IP/30`|



|Option|Purpose|
|---|---|
|`-n`|no DNS lookup|
|`-R`|reverse-DNS lookup for all hosts|
|`-sn`|host discovery only|
